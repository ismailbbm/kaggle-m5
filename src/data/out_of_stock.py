        This function calculates an array of size 28 that will serve as multiplier array to the inference.
        Idea is to transform any element that we consider oos to zero in the inference
        For example if just before the inference, a product had a sequence of 50 zeros while usually it is never zero, we create an array to transform the inference to zero.
        
        Also for each sales_array sequence, we fit a simple curve (1/(1+a*np.sqrt(x))) to give us the probability that a sequence will have a size N given how long it is already (n_zeros_before) and how long the oos sequences were in the history of this sales array
        For example if a sales_array has oos sequences such as [0,0,0,0,0,4,3,2,0,1] meaning that the shortest oos sequence has size 6 and occured 4 times in the past
